# About SCNAV
SCNAV (Pronounced Scuh-NAV) Is a feature rich, silly looking, antivirus For Windows 2000 and up!
![SCNAV1](https://racerretrocoder.github.io/SCNAV/scnav1.PNG)
SCNAV's User Interface is coded with an autorun maker. "Autoruns Pro enterprise"
The actual code of the AV is in python
# Made with Python 3.2 (x32), Autoruns Pro Enterprise
Includes scanning for malware based on MD5
You can delete detected malware with it
File Shredding
File Encryption (coming soon wip)
"Real Time Protection", Active situational storage lurking and file dropping awareness
Compatibility from Windows 2000 and up
# (Note if you get an error about the configuration of the file... Try adding py32 to your PATH enviorment variable. OR Install python 3.2 on your system)

# Requires Portable Python 3.2 Installation
The ISO's in Releases are prepacked with a portable installation of Python 3.2
Python 3.2 must be installed in the folder named py32 in SCNAV2025's Program Files folder (If you install Via DVD (or ISO), All this is done for you. No need to worry about it)

Uses jpassings "Elevate" To gain administrative previlages on NT 6 and up. 
https://github.com/jpassing/elevate/releases/tag/1.0

# Note that if your on Windows XP or lower. Elevate will fail to start. But SCNAV Will continue to operate. This is intended for maximum out of the box single build compatibility


# Advertisement Sound-a-like Features list:

- Compatibility for Windows 2000 and up!
- 32bit!
- Moderately good Real Time Protection (This is still in development. There may be bugs)
- Large threat database! (over 38 million threats!) (NOTE: bases.txt is NOT included in this repo. because it surpases githubs fileupload limit)
- Scan tool(s)
- It plays sounds! (not on windows 2000)
- Antivirus Tool Box!
- Quickly and safely remove detected threats in just 3 clicks! (Only if you ran a scan from the scan page. and detected threats. Extra clicks needed if you just launched SCNAV)
