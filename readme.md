# About SCNAV
SCNAV (Pronounced Scuh-NAV) Is a feature rich, silly looking, antivirus For Windows Vista and up!
![SCNAV1](https://racerretrocoder.github.io/SCNAV/scnav1.PNG)
SCNAV's User Interface is coded with an autorun maker. "Autoruns Pro enterprise"
The actual code of the AV is in python
# Features:

- COMPLETE USER CONTROL! : The user (AKA you!) has FULL CONTROL of the AV, It wont do anything on its own!

- Compatibility for Windows Vista and up!
- 32bit!
- Moderately good Real Time Protection (This is still in development. There may be bugs)
- Large threat database! (over 38 million threats!) (NOTE: bases.txt is NOT included in this repo. because it surpases githubs fileupload limit)
- Scan tool(s)
- It plays sounds!
- Antivirus Tool Box!
- SCNAV Virtual Keyboard! (Part of toolbox)*
- Quickly and safely remove detected threats in just 3 clicks! (Only if you ran a scan from the scan page. and detected threats. Extra clicks needed if you just launched SCNAV)

- I am hosting an update server at ilovetech0629.epizy.com!
